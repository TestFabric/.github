# TestFabric

An application that redefines testing.

## What is TestFabric?

TestFabric allows developers to define the acceptance criteria of a feature or bug as a flow and connect that flow to a specific method in a class. Each flow consists of multiple test cases, and developers write code to pass these test cases, similar to platforms like HackerRank.

By automating the testing process, TestFabric reduces redundant QA efforts and eliminates the need for developers to manually write test cases.

## Why TestFabric?

- Reduces redundant QA testing
- Eliminates the need for developers to write test cases manually
- Provides structured test case execution
- Enhances CI/CD workflows
- Ensures immutable test flows for reliability

## Features

### High-Level Features

- Define acceptance criteria as a flow
- Create and manage test cases
- Integrate with various programming languages
- CI/CD integration
- AI-powered testing enhancements

### Functional Features

- A dashboard to track project insights (coverage, flow pass/fail count, etc.)

### Non-Functional Features

- Ensuring test case immutability (new versions can be created but not modified)
